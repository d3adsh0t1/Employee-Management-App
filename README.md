We will build two projects:
sprintboot-backend (server) – To develop REST API
react-frontend (client) – Consume REST API

In this project, I created a full-stack web application that is basic Employee Management Application with CRUD features:
Create Employee
List Employee
Update Employee
Delete Employee
View Employee
